const MockReceivedText = "Deep within the misty valleys of Grumblehorn, where the sun sets twice a day and the trees hum old pirate shanties, there lived a peculiar man named Oswald Thimblewick. Oswald was not just any man; he was the last remaining Cartographer of the Unseen. His duty? To chart the lands that didn't exist—at least, not until he drew them.\nOne morning, as Oswald dipped his quill into an inkpot of pure distilled moonlight, he received a most peculiar letter. It was written in reverse and sealed with a drop of solidified thunder. The letter read:\n\"Oswald Thimblewick,\nYour services are required immediately. The Grand Kingdom of Nowhereshire is in peril. The Land of Everwas has vanished, and its people are stuck in a temporal loop of endless breakfast. The fate of brunch itself hangs in the balance. You must chart Everwas back into reality before the toast becomes self-aware.”\nOswald sighed. \"Not again.”\nHe grabbed his satchel, stuffed it with parchment, and consulted his last map of Everwas, which was now just a blank piece of paper. With no other choice, he took out the legendary Compass of Maybe, an artifact that pointed not to where you wanted to go, but to where you should have gone three decisions ago.\nFollowing the compass, Oswald found himself standing before the Swirling Door of Possibilities. He knocked, because that’s just what polite people do. The door, unimpressed, turned inside out and folded itself into a moderately aggressive armchair.\n”Ah, a chair,\" Oswald mused. \"Perfect.\" He sat down and was immediately transported into the heart of Nowhereshire’s capital, Middlenot.\nA frantic crowd surrounded him. The Duke of Indecision, known for making proclamations he immediately regretted, rushed forward.\n”Oswald! You must act quickly! The pancake population is demanding sovereignty, and the coffee rivers have stopped flowing. Without brunch, our civilization is doomed!”\nOswald knew there was only one solution. He had to find the lost Atlas of Forgotten Places, said to be kept in the dreaded Library of Misplaced Things.[START-FILE-REFERENCE]ID:1, NAME:CONTRACT, FILETYPE:PDF[END-FILE-REFERENCE]\nThe Library was not easy to reach. It existed only when you weren’t looking for it, and its shelves were guarded by an army of Sentient Bookmarks, each one whispering spoilers to ruin any story you tried to read.\nOswald, being a man of great patience, devised a cunning plan. He pretended to read a book on \"The Lost Art of Chicken Whispering,\" knowing full well it was the most boring book ever written. The Sentient Bookmarks, desperate for something exciting, all gathered around to listen.\nSeizing the moment, Oswald grabbed the Atlas of Forgotten Places and sprinted toward the exit. As he burst through the doors, the ground beneath him turned into an escalator leading directly into the sky.\nAt the top, he found himself staring at the Horizon of Maybe, a shimmering line between existence and nonexistence. Holding the Atlas aloft, he traced the outline of Everwas back onto the map.\nReality trembled. The skies blinked. And then—\nThe land of Everwas reappeared, its breakfast finally complete. The citizens rejoiced as their time loop shattered, and the Duke of Indecision made a bold decree, which he instantly retracted.\nOswald smiled, knowing his job was done. As he walked away, the Compass of Maybe vibrated violently. Another adventure called. But first, he needed a snack.[START-FILE-REFERENCE]ID:2, NAME:TAIGA, FILETYPE:PNG[END-FILE-REFERENCE]Thus, Oswald Thimblewick, Cartographer of the Unseen, wandered off into the unknown, ready to chart the impossible once more.[START-FILE-REFERENCE]ID:3, NAME:WORDFILE, FILETYPE:DOCX[END-FILE-REFERENCE]\n";
